# Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the merge sort algorithm.
# Note: According to Wikipedia "Merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an O (n log n)
# comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that 
# the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output."

# Algorithm:
# Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows :

# Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
# Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
